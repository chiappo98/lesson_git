hi, maybe this time we'll succed

I've done a first commitment
Now I modify again the file

However I already don't know what I'm going to write in this file

I saw that the add and commit commands work, but not the log one!

this file is written with the "micro" editor
I want to verify that git is still working

Again, not completely!
